# Experimenting with Data Pipelines (Frontend)

This is a simple interface with numerical displays and line graphs (single parameter).

For the "backend" scripts see the backend repo:

## Instructions

Here's how to get it running:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/darius-all-new/data-pipeline-experiments-frontend.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

   ```
   cd data-pipeline-frontend/frontend
   ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies.

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start up the development server.

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:5174`. You should see 3 numerical displays and 3 line graphs (all empty until you start the data streams!).

If you encounter any issues or have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
